Code for installing libraries:
pip install cryptography pip install pycryptodome pip install scrypt
Code for importing libraries
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet from Crypto.Cipher import AES import scrypt, os, binascii
import numpy as np
Code for connecting to google drive:

from google.colab import drive drive.mount('/content/drive')
Code for loading the file from google drive
File=np.loadtxt('/content/drive/MyDrive/Project/AESfile',delimiter=',',skiprows=0,dtype=str)

Code for creating files and writing content::

with open('password', 'wb') as pw_file:
pw_file.write(Key)
with open('msg', 'wb') as msg_file: msg_file.write(File)

Code for reading files and storing the data::

with open('password', 'rb') as pw_file: passwordFileContent = pw_file.read()
with open('msg', 'rb') as msg_file: msgFileContent = msg_file.read()

Code for encryption::

def encrypt_AES_GCM(msg, password): kdfSalt = os.urandom(16)
secretKey = scrypt.hash(password, kdfSalt, N=16384, r=8, p=1, buflen=32) aesCipher = AES.new(secretKey, AES.MODE_GCM)
ciphertext, authTag = aesCipher.encrypt_and_digest(msg) return (kdfSalt, ciphertext, aesCipher.nonce, authTag)
